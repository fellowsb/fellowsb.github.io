I put together a short [presentation][lte] on LTE basics.  The increasing data bandwidth availability through spatial multiplexing (MIMO), carrier aggregation (increasing spectrum bandwidth) and modulation (spectral efficiency) never ceases to amaze me.  Stepping back and thinking about the ability to transfer tens of millions of bits of information per second from a hand held radio to destinations around the world is incredible.  We truly live in interesting times!
